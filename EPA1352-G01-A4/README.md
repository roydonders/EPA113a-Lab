## Introduction

Welcome to our model and program designed to analyze the criticality and vulnerability of roads and bridges in Bangladesh. 
This project focuses on utilizing Jupyter Notebooks to identify the top 10 critical roads and bridges, 
crucial for maintaining transportation connectivity and assessing potential risks.

### Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to identify vulnerable or critical bridges, 
particularly focusing on traffic flow along major roads and bridges in Bangladesh. 
We aim to provide visual insights into how this is decided on for the major N-roads.

### Methodology

We have developed a series of Jupyter Notebooks located in the "notebook" folder, each serving a distinct purpose in our analysis. These notebooks are crucial for our (data) modeling process and visualization of results. By running these notebooks, users can follow our step-by-step approach in identifying the top 10 critical roads and bridges and analyzing their vulnerability.
The "model" folder is not used for this assignment.

### Key Components

- **mapstop10assignment4.ipynb**: This notebook is responsible for providing the maps with the top 10 bridges.

- **top10assignment4_vulnerability_matrix.ipynb**: It generates visual output files containing combined criticality and vulnerability metrics for roads and bridges.

- **Top 10 Roads RMMS data.ipynb**: Here, we conduct in-depth analysis of the data, identifying the top 10 critical and vulnerable roads on predefined criteria. 

- **assignment4.ipynb**: This file is responsible for cleaning the data, and providing a BMMS file with traffic flow data appended.

### Usage Instructions

To replicate our analysis or explore our methodology further, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "notebook" folder in the project directory.

2. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook using JupyterLab or any other compatible environment.

3. Execute the cells sequentially to run the code and generate results.

4. Review the outputs, including maps, plots, and analysis summaries, to gain insights into the criticality and vulnerability of roads and bridges.
